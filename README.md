# A repo containing our solutions to the Southampton Code Dojo challenges

The [Southampton Code Dojo][soton-dojo] is a monthly meetup of technical people from around the Southampton area.

We meet at 7pm on the second Thursday of each month, decide on a small challenge to work on, split
up into groups and solve the problem separately (under ~90 minutes), then come together and talk
about the different ways we solved it.

It's a good way of improving our coding abilities by learning from each other, it's a lot of fun,
and programmers of any ability are welcome.
